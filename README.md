# Welcome to haikuVM

This is a small Java Virtual Machine targeting Arduino compatible microcontrollers. It is based on work from Genom Bob and was pulled from [the haikuVM Sourceforge project](http://haiku-vm.sourceforge.net/). The base version pulled was 1.4.3.

## WIP

I have added this project to github because the original project is located in a subversion repo and that makes it harder to collaborate. Second, I am slowly adding gradle build capabilities to each of the sub-projects. My eventual goal is to make this work on the Teensyduino and the Cross The Road Electronics Hero board.
